# What does "bodha" mean?

Bodha (बोध) is a Sanskrit word which can mean idea, thought, understanding, knowing, perception, conciousness, intelligence, reflection, etc. (you get the point). Check out the dictionaries here: [learnsanskrit.cc](https://www.learnsanskrit.cc/translate?search=bodha&dir=se), [Ambuda](https://ambuda.org/tools/dictionaries/mw,shabdasagara,apte,vacaspatyam,shabdakalpadruma,amara,apte-sh,shabdartha-kaustubha/bodha).

Hence, this is a cool name for this blog. I will post here whenever I learn something new or share my thoughts.
