Initial migration of select content from other sources is complete.

Any posts before (below) this one are answers or posts I wrote on Quora. The DRM and KUnit intro is from my vain GSoC proposal (should have put more effort).

I've tried to correct any typos, fix up broken sentences and missing references, etc. without changing the content much. Still, I'm sorry if there are any citation etc. issues in the content, good referencing wasn't something on the top of the mind for the teenage Quora user.

Note: I'm no longer on Quora, the platform has gone down the drain. Before deleting my account, I requested all my data.
