The holy second law is untouched till now (note: in the question thread), such is the power of the second law. It is in a way the basis of *force* as we perceive in daily life. Yeah, let's play with the force itself.

Here's the second law.

> The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force.

So we write it in mathematical notation as
$$
\vec{F} \propto \dot{\vec{p}}
$$

I modify the law to be…

> The rate of change of momentum of a body is ***inversely*** proportional to the force applied, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force.

Oooh, so now the mathematical form would change to…

$$
\vec{F} \propto \dfrac{1}{\dot{\vec{p}}}
$$

Oh, hey, since $\vec{p}=m\vec{v}$, as you slow down the force would ***increase***.

That is, in familiar form…

$$
\vec{F} = \dfrac{1}{m\vec{a}}
$$

I can't fathom the craziness it would make… like, an ant commits a genocide?

To lessen the force, you would need to go *more* faster.

So when a car hits you, it needs to go ***faster to stop.***

I must have made the grandfather of paradoxical physics proud.

On the flip side, we can travel faster than light. Yay!
